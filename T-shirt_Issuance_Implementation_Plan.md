# T-shirt Issuance Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the step-by-step implementation plan for the T-shirt issuance functionality in the SGSVolunteers application. The plan is divided into phases to ensure a systematic approach to development.

## Phase 1: Database Schema Updates

### Tasks:
1. **Execute Database Schema Changes**
   - Run the SQL script `T-shirt_Issuance_DB_Changes.sql` on the Supabase database
   - Verify that all tables and columns are created correctly
   - Test the database functions for QR code generation and validation

2. **Update TypeScript Type Definitions**
   - Update `src/lib/types/supabase.ts` to include the new tables and columns
   - Add type definitions for the new database functions

### Deliverables:
- Updated database schema
- Updated TypeScript type definitions
- Verification that database functions work as expected

## Phase 2: Volunteer Profile T-shirt Preferences

### Tasks:
1. **Create T-shirt Preferences Component**
   - Implement the `TShirtPreferences` component as outlined in the UI Components document
   - Add the component to the volunteer profile page

2. **Update Profile Page**
   - Modify the profile page to fetch and display the volunteer's current T-shirt size preference
   - Pass the necessary props to the T-shirt preferences component

3. **Test Preference Setting**
   - Verify that volunteers can set and update their T-shirt size preference
   - Ensure that preferences are correctly stored in the database

### Deliverables:
- Functional T-shirt preferences component
- Updated profile page with T-shirt preferences section
- Ability for volunteers to set and update their T-shirt size preference

## Phase 3: QR Code Generation

### Tasks:
1. **Install Required Packages**
   - Install `qrcode.react` for QR code generation
   - Install `html5-qrcode` for QR code scanning

2. **Create QR Code Generator Component**
   - Implement the `QRCodeGenerator` component as outlined in the UI Components document
   - Add the component to the volunteer profile page

3. **Implement QR Code Generation API**
   - Create an API endpoint to call the database function for QR code generation
   - Handle authentication and authorization for the endpoint

4. **Test QR Code Generation**
   - Verify that volunteers can generate QR codes
   - Test QR code download functionality
   - Ensure that QR codes are correctly stored in the database

### Deliverables:
- Functional QR code generator component
- API endpoint for QR code generation
- Ability for volunteers to generate and download QR codes

## Phase 4: T-shirt Inventory Management

### Tasks:
1. **Enhance Inventory Management Page**
   - Update the existing inventory page to include CRUD operations for T-shirt inventory
   - Add inventory status indicators (low stock, out of stock)
   - Implement filtering and sorting options

2. **Create Inventory Reports**
   - Add a section for inventory reports
   - Implement reports for current inventory levels, issuance history, etc.

3. **Test Inventory Management**
   - Verify that admins can add, update, and view T-shirt inventory
   - Test inventory reports for accuracy

### Deliverables:
- Enhanced inventory management page
- Inventory reporting functionality
- Ability for admins to manage T-shirt inventory

## Phase 5: QR Code Scanning and T-shirt Issuance

### Tasks:
1. **Enhance QR Scanner Component**
   - Update the existing QR scanner component to use the `html5-qrcode` library
   - Implement QR code validation using the database function
   - Display volunteer information after scanning, including their size preference

2. **Implement T-shirt Issuance Logic**
   - Update the issuance process to mark QR codes as used
   - Update inventory when T-shirts are issued
   - Add validation to prevent duplicate issuances

3. **Create Manual Issuance Option**
   - Implement a manual issuance option for cases where QR scanning is not possible
   - Add volunteer search functionality for manual issuance

4. **Test T-shirt Issuance**
   - Verify that admins can scan QR codes and issue T-shirts
   - Test manual issuance functionality
   - Ensure that inventory is correctly updated when T-shirts are issued

### Deliverables:
- Enhanced QR scanner component with actual scanning functionality
- Complete T-shirt issuance workflow
- Manual issuance option for fallback

## Phase 6: Integration and Testing

### Tasks:
1. **Integrate All Components**
   - Ensure that all components work together seamlessly
   - Test the complete workflow from preference setting to T-shirt issuance

2. **User Acceptance Testing**
   - Conduct user acceptance testing with volunteers and admins
   - Gather feedback and make necessary adjustments

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Test the system with a large number of volunteers
   - Optimize database queries and component rendering as needed

### Deliverables:
- Fully integrated T-shirt issuance functionality
- User acceptance testing report
- Performance optimization recommendations

## Phase 7: Documentation and Deployment

### Tasks:
1. **Update Documentation**
   - Update user documentation to include T-shirt issuance workflow
   - Create admin documentation for inventory management and T-shirt issuance

2. **Prepare for Deployment**
   - Create a deployment plan
   - Prepare database migration scripts

3. **Deploy to Production**
   - Deploy the new functionality to the production environment
   - Monitor for any issues

### Deliverables:
- Updated user and admin documentation
- Deployment plan
- Successful production deployment

## Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Dependencies |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| 1. Database Schema Updates | 1 day | None |
| 2. Volunteer Profile T-shirt Preferences | 2 days | Phase 1 |
| 3. QR Code Generation | 2 days | Phase 1 |
| 4. T-shirt Inventory Management | 3 days | Phase 1 |
| 5. QR Code Scanning and T-shirt Issuance | 3 days | Phases 1, 3, 4 |
| 6. Integration and Testing | 2 days | Phases 2, 3, 4, 5 |
| 7. Documentation and Deployment | 1 day | Phase 6 |

**Total Duration: 14 days**

## Resources Required

1. **Development Team**
   - Frontend Developer (React, TypeScript)
   - Backend Developer (Supabase, PostgreSQL)
   - QA Engineer

2. **Tools and Technologies**
   - Supabase for database and authentication
   - React for frontend development
   - QR code libraries (`qrcode.react`, `html5-qrcode`)
   - Testing tools

3. **Infrastructure**
   - Development environment
   - Testing environment
   - Production environment

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| QR code scanning issues on different devices | High | Test on multiple devices, provide manual issuance fallback |
| Database performance with large number of QR codes | Medium | Implement indexing, consider cleanup of old/used QR codes |
| User adoption of QR code system | Medium | Provide clear documentation, consider alternative methods |
| Inventory management complexity | Low | Simplify UI, provide clear instructions for admins |

## Success Criteria

1. Volunteers can set their T-shirt size preferences
2. Volunteers can generate and download QR codes
3. Admins can manage T-shirt inventory
4. Admins can scan QR codes and issue T-shirts
5. System correctly tracks T-shirt issuances and updates inventory
6. Complete workflow is user-friendly and efficient

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to developing the T-shirt issuance functionality for the SGSVolunteers application. By following this plan, the development team can ensure that all aspects of the functionality are properly implemented and tested before deployment to production.
