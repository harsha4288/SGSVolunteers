## 4. Implementation Tasks
    (Break down the feature implementation into smaller, actionable tasks. This section can be filled out by a human developer or an AI planning assistant using `ai_prompts/PLAN_FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATION.md`.)
    1. Task 1: (e.g., Create `NewComponent.tsx` in `src/app/app/feature_module/components/`)
    2. Task 2: (e.g., Add `fetchNewData` function to `src/app/app/feature_module/services/data-service.ts`)
    3. Task 3: (e.g., Update `useFeatureData` hook in `src/app/app/feature_module/hooks/`)
    4. Task 4: (e.g., Write unit tests for `NewComponent.tsx`)
    5. Task 5: (e.g., Write integration tests for `data-service.ts`)

## 5. Testing Plan
