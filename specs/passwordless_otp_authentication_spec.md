# Feature Specification: Passwordless OTP Authentication

## 1. Overview
- **Summary:** Replace the current user impersonation system with secure passwordless authentication using email-based OTP verification via Supabase Auth.
- **Goals:** 
  - Eliminate hardcoded credentials and user impersonation security risks
  - Implement proper authentication flow with email OTP verification
  - Ensure secure session management and user identification
  - Maintain seamless user experience with one-time device/browser validation
- **Non-Goals:** 
  - Password-based authentication
  - Multi-factor authentication beyond email OTP
  - Social media login integration
  - Phone number OTP verification
- **Success Metrics:** 
  - 100% removal of impersonation code and hardcoded credentials
  - Successful OTP delivery and verification rate >95%
  - User session persistence across browser sessions
  - Zero authentication bypass vulnerabilities

## 2. Detailed Description

### User Stories
- As a **User**, I want to log in with just my email address so that I don't need to remember passwords
- As a **User**, I want to receive a verification code via email so that I can securely access the system
- As a **User**, I want my login session to persist so that I don't need to re-authenticate frequently
- As an **Admin**, I want to ensure only authorized users can access the system without impersonation backdoors

### Current Behavior
- Login page (`/login`) displays a list of all profiles for impersonation
- Users can select any profile to impersonate without authentication
- System stores impersonation data in localStorage and cookies
- Hardcoded Supabase credentials serve as fallback in production
- No actual authentication verification occurs

### Proposed Behavior
1. **Email Entry Flow:**
   - User visits `/login` and sees clean email input form
   - User enters email address and clicks "Send Code"
   - System validates email format and sends OTP via Supabase Auth
   - User sees "Check your email" confirmation message

2. **OTP Verification Flow:**
   - User receives 6-digit OTP code via email
   - User enters code in verification form
   - System validates OTP with Supabase Auth
   - On success: User is authenticated and redirected to dashboard
   - On failure: User sees error message and can retry

3. **Session Management:**
   - Authenticated sessions persist across browser sessions
   - User profile data loaded from Supabase based on authenticated email
   - Session automatically refreshes when valid
   - Logout clears session and redirects to login

### Edge Cases & Error Handling
- Invalid email format: Show validation error before sending OTP
- Email not found in system: Show "User not found" error
- OTP expired (1 hour): Allow user to request new OTP
- OTP rate limiting: Show "Please wait 60 seconds" when hitting limits
- Network errors: Show retry option with exponential backoff
- Multiple verification attempts: Lock out after 5 failed attempts for 15 minutes

## 3. Technical Details

### 3.1. UI/UX Design
- **Key UI Components:**
  - `EmailInputForm`: Clean email entry with validation
  - `OTPVerificationForm`: 6-digit code input with resend option
  - `AuthLoadingSpinner`: Loading states during OTP operations
  - `AuthErrorAlert`: Error message display component
  
- **User Flow:**
  1. `/login` → Email input form
  2. Email submission → Loading → OTP sent confirmation
  3. OTP verification form → Loading → Success/Error
  4. Success → Redirect to `/app/dashboard`

- **Accessibility Considerations:**
  - Keyboard navigation between OTP input fields
  - Screen reader announcements for OTP status
  - High contrast error states
  - Focus management during form transitions

### 3.2. Data Model Changes
- **Database Tables Affected:**
  - `profiles`: Read user profile data based on authenticated email
  - `profile_roles`: Read user roles after authentication
  - No schema changes required (existing tables sufficient)

- **Data Validation:**
  - Email format validation on client and server
  - OTP code format validation (6 digits)
  - Profile existence validation after successful OTP

### 3.3. API/Service Layer Changes
- **New Endpoints/Functions:**
  - `sendOTP(email: string)`: Wrapper for `supabase.auth.signInWithOtp()`
  - `verifyOTP(email: string, token: string)`: Wrapper for `supabase.auth.verifyOtp()`
  - `getCurrentUser()`: Get authenticated user profile data
  
- **Modified Endpoints/Functions:**
  - Update auth callback route to handle OTP verification redirects
  - Remove impersonation-related server actions

- **Request/Response Payloads:**
  ```typescript
  // OTP Send Request
  { email: string }
  
  // OTP Verify Request  
  { email: string, token: string }
  
  // Auth Response
  { user: User | null, session: Session | null, error: Error | null }
  ```

### 3.4. Hook Changes
- **New Hooks:**
  - `useOTPAuth()`: Manages OTP send/verify flow states
  - `useAuthSession()`: Manages user session state
  
- **Modified Hooks:**
  - Remove impersonation logic from existing auth hooks
  - Update `useUserRole()` to work with actual authenticated user

- **State Managed:**
  - OTP flow state (idle, sending, sent, verifying, verified, error)
  - Authentication session state
  - User profile data
  - Error states and messages

## 6. Troubleshooting & Solutions

### 6.1. Magic Link vs OTP Issue ✅ RESOLVED

**Problem:** Supabase `signInWithOtp()` was sending magic links instead of OTP codes.

**Root Cause:** Supabase's `signInWithOtp()` sends magic links by default. The method name is misleading - it requires email template configuration to send actual OTP codes.

**Solution:**
1. **Email Template Configuration:** In Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Email Templates
2. **Template Modification:** Replace `{{ .ConfirmationURL }}` with `{{ .Token }}` in the Magic Link template
3. **Professional Template:** Implement spam-resistant HTML template with proper structure

### 6.2. Profile Linking Issue ✅ RESOLVED

**Problem:** Profiles had `user_id = NULL`, causing authentication failures.

**Root Cause:** OTP service was set to `shouldCreateUser: false`, preventing Supabase auth user creation.

**Solution:**
1. **Enable User Creation:** Changed `shouldCreateUser: true` in OTP service
2. **Profile Linking:** Auth callback automatically links created auth users to existing profiles via email
3. **Migration Strategy:** Existing profiles get linked on first successful OTP authentication

### 6.3. Session Management Issue ✅ RESOLVED

**Problem:** After successful OTP verification, users were redirected back to login instead of dashboard.

**Root Cause:** Session establishment timing - redirect occurred before session was fully established.

**Solution:**
1. **Timing Fix:** Added 1-second delay after OTP verification before dashboard redirect
2. **Session Persistence:** Improved session detection in `useAuthSession` hook
3. **Proper State Management:** Enhanced auth state transitions for better UX

### 6.4. Email Deliverability ✅ RESOLVED

**Problem:** OTP emails potentially going to spam folders.

**Solution:**
1. **Professional Template:** Implemented branded, legitimate-looking email template
2. **Anti-Spam Features:** Added proper HTML structure, sender identity, and business purpose
3. **Clear Messaging:** Professional layout with clear instructions and security messaging

## 7. Open Questions & Discussion Points

1. **✅ RESOLVED - Profile Linking Strategy:** Implemented automatic email-based profile linking for authenticated users
2. **✅ RESOLVED - Session Duration:** Using default Supabase session timeout with proper refresh handling
3. **RLS Policy Granularity:** Should Team Leads have access to all volunteers or only their assigned seva categories?
4. **Fallback Authentication:** Should we maintain a temporary admin override for emergency access during transition?
5. **Error Logging:** How should we log authentication errors for monitoring and debugging?

## 8. Dependencies

### Other Features
- All existing features depend on this authentication system
- User role management depends on proper user identification
- Profile data access depends on authenticated sessions

### External Libraries
- `@supabase/supabase-js` (already installed)

- No additional external libraries required

### Supabase Configuration Requirements

**✅ COMPLETED:** Email OTP authentication has been configured in Supabase:

1. **Auth Settings:** ✅ Email auth enabled and redirect URLs configured
2. **Email Service:** ✅ Using Supabase default email service
3. **Rate Limiting:** ✅ Default 1 OTP per 60 seconds, expires after 1 hour
4. **Environment Variables:** ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` configured
5. **✅ Email Template Configuration:** Modified Magic Link template to send OTP codes instead of links
   - **Template Change:** Replaced `{{ .ConfirmationURL }}` with `{{ .Token }}` in email template
   - **Professional Email Design:** Implemented spam-resistant HTML template with proper structure
   - **Deliverability:** Added proper sender identity and legitimate business purpose

### Row Level Security Dependencies
- **Database Policies:** All table access depends on proper RLS policies
- **Profile Linking:** Authentication depends on email-based profile matching
- **Role Verification:** User permissions depend on profile_roles table and RLS policies

## 9. Row Level Security Implementation

### 9.1. RLS Policy Definitions

#### User Isolation Policies
```sql
-- Users can only see their own profile
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own profile" ON public.profiles
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own profile" ON public.profiles
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Users can only see volunteers linked to their profile
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their volunteers" ON public.volunteers
  FOR SELECT USING (
    profile_id IN (
      SELECT id FROM public.profiles WHERE auth.uid() = user_id
    )
  );
```

#### Role-Based Access Policies
```sql
-- Admin full access policy
CREATE POLICY "Admin full access" ON public.profiles
  FOR ALL USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM public.profiles p
      JOIN public.profile_roles pr ON p.id = pr.profile_id
      JOIN public.roles r ON pr.role_id = r.id
      WHERE p.user_id = auth.uid() AND r.role_name = 'Admin'
    )
  );

-- Team Lead limited access policy
CREATE POLICY "Team Lead seva access" ON public.volunteers
  FOR SELECT USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM public.profiles p
      JOIN public.profile_roles pr ON p.id = pr.profile_id
      JOIN public.roles r ON pr.role_id = r.id
      WHERE p.user_id = auth.uid() AND r.role_name = 'Team Lead'
    )
  );
```

#### Public Data Policies
```sql
-- All authenticated users can read events, time slots, seva categories
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can read events" ON public.events
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can read time slots" ON public.time_slots
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can read seva categories" ON public.seva_categories
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);
```

### 9.2. Profile Linking Strategy

#### New User Registration Flow
1. User authenticates with OTP
2. System checks if profile exists with matching email
3. If profile exists: Link `auth.uid()` to `profiles.user_id`
4. If no profile: Create new profile with authenticated user data

#### Existing User Migration
1. Existing profiles have `user_id = NULL`
2. On first OTP authentication: Update `user_id` with `auth.uid()`
3. Subsequent logins use existing profile linkage

### 9.3. Emergency Access Strategy

#### Temporary Admin Override
- Maintain fallback admin access during transition
- Remove after all users successfully migrate to OTP
- Document override usage for audit purposes

- ❌ **Session establishment timing BROKEN**
- ✅ Supabase auth user creation and profile linking
- ✅ Error handling for all failure scenarios

### 6.5. Session Establishment Failure ❌ OPEN ISSUE

**Problem:** After successful OTP verification, session is not established, causing infinite redirect loop between `/login` and `/app/dashboard`.

**Symptoms:**
- OTP verification returns success on client-side
- User redirected to `/app/dashboard`
- Middleware session check: `{ hasSession: false, hasUser: false, userEmail: undefined }`
- Middleware redirects back to `/login`
- Login page detects "authenticated" user, redirects to dashboard
- **Infinite loop:** `GET /login 200` requests every 150-300ms

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The issue appears to be that OTP verification succeeds client-side but the session is not properly established server-side for middleware detection.

**Debugging Attempts Made:**

1. **❌ Attempt 1: Remove Auth Callback Route Logic**
   - **Theory:** Callback route for magic links interfering with OTP flow
   - **Action:** Added comments clarifying callback is for magic links only
   - **Result:** No change - session still not established

2. **❌ Attempt 2: Fix Infinite React Re-renders**
   - **Theory:** `useAuthSession` hook causing infinite loops
   - **Action:** Removed circular dependencies, empty dependency array in useEffect
   - **Result:** Fixed React errors but session issue persists

3. **❌ Attempt 3: Simplify Middleware**
   - **Theory:** Middleware auto-linking causing redirect loop
   - **Action:** Removed middleware profile linking, moved to client-side
   - **Result:** No change - middleware still not detecting session

4. **❌ Attempt 4: Optimize Login Page Redirects**
   - **Theory:** Client-side redirect timing issues
   - **Action:** Used `router.replace()`, removed double redirects, added loading states
   - **Result:** Better UX but core session issue remains

5. **❌ Attempt 5: Restrict Middleware Scope**
   - **Theory:** Middleware running on too many routes
   - **Action:** Changed matcher to only `/app/:path*` and `/`
   - **Result:** Reduced middleware calls but session still not detected

6. **❌ Attempt 6: Fix Supabase Client Configuration**
   - **Theory:** `detectSessionInUrl: false` preventing OTP session detection
   - **Action:** Set `detectSessionInUrl: true` and `flowType: 'pkce'`
   - **Result:** **NO CHANGE** - session still not established after OTP verification

**Current Middleware Logs:**
```
Middleware executing for: /app/dashboard
Middleware session check: {
  hasSession: false,
  hasUser: false,
  userEmail: undefined,
  error: undefined
}
No session found, redirecting to login
```

**Next Investigation Areas:**
1. **Server-Side Session Sync:** Check if OTP verification properly creates server-side session
2. **Cookie Handling:** Verify session cookies are set correctly after OTP verification
3. **Supabase Auth Configuration:** Review if additional Supabase settings needed for OTP
4. **SSR vs Client Session Mismatch:** Investigate if server and client see different session states
5. **Auth State Change Timing:** Check if `onAuthStateChange` events are firing correctly

**Workaround Needed:**
Temporarily disable middleware authentication checks to allow dashboard access for testing other features, or implement session debugging tools to understand why server-side session detection fails after successful OTP verification.
